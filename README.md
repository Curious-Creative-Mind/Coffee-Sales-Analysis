# Maven Roasters Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

## Project Overview:

Maven Roasters is a fictional  NYC based coffee shop operating across three distinct locations.

The coffee shop has  6 months data on its sales, orders, product offerings and stores  that has been previously underutilized. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover critical insights that will improve Maven Roasters’ commercial success.   

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

-	**Sales Trends Analysis** - Evaluation of sales patterns based on seasonality and dimensions such as region, Order Volume.
-	**Product Level Performance** - An analysis of Maven Roasters’ various product types and category, understanding their impact on sales.
-	**Regional Comparisons** - An evaluation of sales and orders by store location.

## Data Structure and Initial Checks:

The shops’ database structure as seen below consists of a table sales_revenue with a total row count of 1,49,116 records and a custom created table calendar with 181 rows.



Prior to beginning the analysis, a variety of checks were conducted for quality control and familiarization with the datasets using Power Query.

### Data Quality Check:

-	Checking blanks
-	Data Validity
-	Changed data type
-	Extracted order time by adding new conditional column
  
## Executive Summary:

### Overview of Findings:

The overall sales trend seems to be steadily increasing every month with an exception of slight dip in February. This same trend can be seen in terms of Order Volume as well with a  sharp rise in order volume from  April to May. While this sharp rise could be attributed to social media promotions and campaigns run by the coffee shop, the following sections will explore additional contributing factors and highlight key opportunity areas for improvement.

Below is the overview page from the PowerBI dashboard and more examples are included throughout the report. The entire interactive dashboard can be downloaded here.

### Sales Trends:

-	The coffee chain saw a **steady rise in sales and order volume monthwise** from January to June except a **slight dip in February**.
-	There was also a **sharp rise in the order volume in the month of May by 11,764** quantities sold as compared to **average rise in the order volume of 3,577 per month** which can be attributed to successful social media campaign.
-	The coffee chain sees **maximum rush during the morning hours*** followed by afternoon and thus the **maximum revenue** is generated **during the first half of the day** comprising almost **55.5%** of the total revenue generated during the entire day. This can be due to the habit of starting the day with morning refreshment by the office going and college going crowd.
-	**Sales metrics during the weekdays (Monday-Friday) is slightly higher** than during the  weekends. This could be possibly due to the office going and college going customers.

### Product Performance:

-	**66% of the coffee chain’s orders are just from 2 product categories Coffee and Tea** accounting for $466K revenue.
-	**In terms of Order Volume, 3 product types have consistently occupied  all time top 3 positions** comprising Brewed Chai Tea, Gourmet Brewed Coffee and Barista Espresso. These account for **34% of total revenue.**
-	Product categorywise, Coffee remains the all time maximum contributor in the share of sales pie followed by Tea but **Bakery** seems to occupy the **3rd position during the morning and afternoon hours** only, as **Drinking Chocolate** surpasses it **during the evening and night hours.**

### Regional Comparisons:

-	Coffee shops in **all 3 locations** seems to perform almost at **similar level in terms of sales** however **Hell’s Kitchen** remained the **best performer** throughout the 6 months. 
-	**Lower Manhattan** has **significantly lower sales during the night time** (comprising only **12%** of the total night sales ) as compared to other 2 locations.
-	Lower Manhattan does most of its sales during the first half of the day while Astoria picks up after the morning hours as compared to other 2 locations.

## Recommendations:

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided:

-	The **marketing strategies** that probably resulted in sharp rise in order volume from April to May can **be replicated and capitalized on.**
-	Improving customer service and experience during the first half of the day to cater to the high demands during rush hours by **increasing staff in morning shift.**
-	**Special offers and combos** can be used **to attract the college going and office going customers** as they seem to form a large chunk of the customer base.
-	Try to **investigate the reason behind significant lower sales in the Lower Manhattan location during the night time** and come up with solutions to boost its sales during the night time as well.
-	**Diversify products under Bakery and Drinking Chocolate categories** as these have the potential to increase their share in sales pie with **special focus on Hot Chocolate** due to its relatively higher Order Volume.
